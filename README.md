Here we will build a face recognition system. Many of the ideas presented here are from [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). In lecture, we also talked about [DeepFace](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/deepface-closing-the-gap-to-human-level-performance-in-face-verification.pdf). 

Face recognition problems commonly fall into two categories: 

- **Face Verification** - "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem. 
- **Face Recognition** - "who is this person?". For example, the video lecture showed a face recognition video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs) of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem. 

FaceNet learns a neural network that encodes a face image into a vector of 128 numbers. By comparing two such vectors, you can then determine if two pictures are of the same person.

**In this project, we will:**
- Implement the triplet loss function
- Use a pretrained model to map face images into 128-dimensional encodings
- Use these encodings to perform face verification and face recognition

# Naive Face Verification

In Face Verification, you're given two images and you have to tell if they are of the same person. The simplest way to do this is to compare the two images pixel-by-pixel. If the distance between the raw images are less than a chosen threshold, it may be the same person

Of course, this algorithm performs really poorly, since the pixel values change dramatically due to variations in lighting, orientation of the person's face, even minor changes in head position, and so on. 

We can see that rather than using the raw image, you can learn an encoding $f(img)$ so that element-wise comparisons of this encoding gives more accurate judgements as to whether two pictures are of the same person.

# Encoding face images into a 128-dimensional vector 

## Using an ConvNet  to compute encodings

The FaceNet model takes a lot of data and a long time to train. So following common practice in applied deep learning settings, let's just load weights that someone else has already trained. The network architecture follows the Inception model from [Szegedy *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842). We have provided an inception network implementation. You can look in the file `inception_blocks.py` to see how it is implemented.

The key things are:

- This network uses 96x96 dimensional RGB images as its input. Specifically, inputs a face image (or batch of $m$ face images) as a tensor of shape $(m, n_C, n_H, n_W) = (m, 3, 96, 96)$ 
- It outputs a matrix of shape $(m, 128)$ that encodes each input face image into a 128-dimensional vector.

By using a 128-neuron fully connected layer as its last layer, the model ensures that the output is an encoding vector of size 128. You then use the encodings the compare two face images as follows:

So, an encoding is a good one if: 
- The encodings of two images of the same person are quite similar to each other 
- The encodings of two images of different persons are very different

The triplet loss function formalizes this, and tries to "push" the encodings of two images of the same person (Anchor and Positive) closer together, while "pulling" the encodings of two images of different persons (Anchor, Negative) further apart.

# The Triplet Loss

For an image  x, we denote its encoding  f(x), where f is the function computed by the neural network.

Training will use triplets of images  (A,P,N)(A,P,N) :

A is an "Anchor" image--a picture of a person.
P is a "Positive" image--a picture of the same person as the Anchor image.
N is a "Negative" image--a picture of a different person than the Anchor image.

# FaceNet Model

FaceNet is trained by minimizing the triplet loss. But since training requires a lot of data and a lot of computation, we won't train it from scratch here. Instead, we load a previously trained model. Load a model using the following cell; this might take a couple of minutes to run.
